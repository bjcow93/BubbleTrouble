# BubbleTrouble
## Background and Overview
  Bubble Trouble is a simple game that involves 1 or 2 players moving left and right on a screen, dodging a number of bubbles of various sizes that bounce around the screen. While a player moves around dodging the bubbles, they will also try to position themselves underneath a bubble in order to shoot a chain straight up, popping the bubble. Once popped, bigger bubbles will break apart into 2 smaller sized bubbles. The smallest bubbles will simply disappear once popped. Once all of the bubbles are popped, the player moves on to the next level.
  My motivation for duplicating this game comes from all of the time that my younger self spent playing it with my friends.
